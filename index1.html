<h1>MEENU THIYAGARAJAN</h1>
<p>This is Meenu done B.E in Information technology.I am harvard extension school student wanted to learn about html and css.Dynamic web applications is a wonderful course
to learn in and out of Html and CSS.I learnt more about html within a start of this course and in my first project.Eagerly waiting to learn more about this course.
I am so convinced about this course to learn more and update my knowledge.The online video lectures by Susan Buck is very interesting to learn.
</p>
<p> I am married and blessed with a 6 yr old kid named Aravind.He is my cutie pie.I am very happy with my family.Not yet planned for the next kid.
My ambition is to earn a degree as Masters from Harvard extension school.Hope it works out well,looking for a great future :)
